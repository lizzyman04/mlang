# MLang Runtime Architecture

The MLang Runtime is responsible for managing the execution of MLang programs. It processes source files through multiple phases: lexing, parsing, interpreting, and executing â€” including handling built-in features such as math resolution, console printging, and user-defined functions.

## ðŸ§¬ Runtime Pipeline

```plaintext
source.mlang
    â†“
[Lexer]          â†’ Tokens
    â†“
[Parser]         â†’ AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)
    â†“
[Interpreter]    â†’ Runtime Execution (scopes, memory, functions)
    â†“
[Built-in Engine]â†’ Console, Math Engine, prints, Errors
```

More details coming soon!

## ðŸŽ¯ Runtime Goals

* Provide a predictable and debuggable environment
* Offer minimal core abstractions
* Prioritize simplicity, clarity, and educational value
* Allow expressive symbolic computation without complexity
